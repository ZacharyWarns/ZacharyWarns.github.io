<h1>
    Summary:
</h1>
<p>
    The story starts with attending Augsburg for the first time in fall of 2021. I took my an introductory course in programming because I was intrested in
    devolping games. This is where I started to love programming , because of my new found passion I sought to challenge myself further by joining the video game development club at 
    the U of M. Developing Games was one of the more challenging things I have done but through persitence eventually my first project was realesed to my itch page. 
    From there I continued deveolping greater games until my last which was God Protection Service. A game that i can confidently say that most would get
    10-20 minutes of fun. My love for games continued as I got my grant accepted to research Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. My story of College and beyond is one
    of finishing increasingly challenging projects because I love a good Challenge.
